The Goal of this project was to use computer vision to recognize human facial expression (happy/neutral/sad/angry) and generate real time animated representation of that expression.
This animation imitates facial expression in real time.

Devices & Software list:
* 720p webcam
* PC
* TouchDesigner (https://derivative.ca/)

Computer Vision (python): 
Facial expression model was trained by using machine learning. 
The data was used to recognize facial expression.

Detected expression data is sent to Touchdesigner to generate animated representation of that expression.
